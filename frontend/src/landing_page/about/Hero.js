We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010<br/> with the goal of breaking all barriers that traders and <br/>investors face in India in terms of cost, support, and <br/>technology. We named the company Zerodha, a <br/>combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit word for<br/> barrier.

Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house<br/> technology have made us the biggest stock broker in<br/> India.

Over 1+ Crore clients place millions of orders every day <br/>through our powerful ecosystem of investment<br/> platforms, contributing over 15% of all Indian retail<br/> trading volumes.</p>

In addition, we run a number of popular open online<br/> educational and community initiatives to empower retail<br/>  traders and investors.

Rainmatter, our fintech fund and incubator, has invested<br/>in several fintech startups with the goal of growing the <br/>Indian capital markets.

And yet, we are always up to something new every day.<br/> Catch up on the latest updates on our blog or see what<br/> the media is saying about us.
